AWS Load Balancer Controller is deployed and the LoadBalancer is expected to be active, let's confirm everything is functioning properly.

✅ 1. Confirm ALB Controller Pod is Running
bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep aws-load-balancer
Expected output:

css
aws-load-balancer-controller-xxxxxx   1/1   Running   0   [age]

✅ 2. Confirm Webhook Service Has Endpoints
bash
kubectl get endpoints -n kube-system aws-load-balancer-webhook-service
Expected output:

lua
NAME                                ENDPOINTS             AGE
aws-load-balancer-webhook-service   10.x.x.x:443,...       Xd

✅ If you see endpoints, the mutating webhook is working — NGINX LoadBalancer service can now apply successfully.

✅ 3. Check NGINX LoadBalancer Service
bash
kubectl get svc -n prod

You should see:

pgsql
NAME                           TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP                          PORT(S)        AGE
nginx-prod-webapp-aalimsee     LoadBalancer   10.x.x.x       aabbccddeeff.elb.amazonaws.com       80:nnnn/TCP    Xm

✅ EXTERNAL-IP should be populated (can take 30–60 seconds)

✅ 4. Test NGINX Response
Once EXTERNAL-IP is available:

bash
curl http://<EXTERNAL-IP>
Expected output: The default NGINX HTML page.

✅ 5. (Optional) Describe LoadBalancer Service
bash
kubectl describe svc nginx-prod-webapp-aalimsee -n prod
Check for:

Target type: IP or instance
Events for provisioning the ALB
Final state messages

✅ 6. Confirm DNS Resolution (if Route 53 is configured)
If you're using a custom domain:

bash
nslookup <custom-domain>
And confirm it's resolving to the ALB hostname.

Let me know the output of:

bash
kubectl get svc -n prod
…and I’ll help you verify the LoadBalancer response + test from browser or CLI.
