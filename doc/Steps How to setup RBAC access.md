# Issue
## Error from server (Forbidden): services is forbidden: User "arn:aws:iam::255945442255:user/clifford_ce9" cannot list resource "services" in API group "" in the namespace "argocd"


You said:
what if i have the following setting,     clifford_ce9 = {
      principal_arn       = "arn:aws:iam::255945442255:user/clifford_ce9"
      kubernetes_groups   = ["cluster-admins"]
      policy_associations = []
    }


Great ‚Äî based on your config:

hcl
clifford_ce9 = {
  principal_arn       = "arn:aws:iam::255945442255:user/clifford_ce9"
  kubernetes_groups   = ["cluster-admins"]
  policy_associations = []
}

You're mapping the IAM user clifford_ce9 to the Kubernetes group cluster-admins, which should grant full access ‚Äî including the ability to list services in any namespace.

üîç So Why Are You Getting "Forbidden"?
There are a few common reasons:

‚úÖ 1. Group Not Bound in Kubernetes RBAC
Check if cluster-admins is bound to the actual cluster-admin ClusterRole. This is often done via:

yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: cluster-admins-binding
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-admin
subjects:
- kind: Group
  name: cluster-admins
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io

If this binding is missing, then your cluster-admins group won‚Äôt have any real access.

Check it:

bash
kubectl get clusterrolebinding cluster-admins-binding -o yaml
If it doesn't exist, apply the above YAML.

‚úÖ 2. Auth Mapping Not Yet Active
If you're using authentication_mode = "API" with access_entries, ensure:

Your EKS control plane is refreshed (wait a few minutes after terraform apply).

You're using aws eks update-kubeconfig or a kubeconfig that supports Exec auth mode for IAM.

‚úÖ 3. User Not Using the Right Identity
Check that your kubectl context is actually authenticating as clifford_ce9. You can run:

bash
kubectl auth can-i list services -n argocd --as=clifford_ce9
Or check actual identity:

bash
kubectl get --raw /apis/authentication.k8s.io/v1/tokenreviews
Or temporarily deploy a Pod and inspect the environment variables if debugging deeper.

‚úÖ Quick Fix Summary
If cluster-admins isn‚Äôt already bound:

bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: cluster-admins-binding
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-admin
subjects:
- kind: Group
  name: cluster-admins
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
EOF
Let me know if you want to restrict this user to less than cluster-admin access or only certain namespaces.

# To apply
kubectl apply -f cluster-admins-binding.yaml  


# üîß Fix This by Granting RBAC Access in Kubernetes
You need to bind the IAM user (assumed to be mapped via EKS aws-auth ConfigMap) to a Role or ClusterRole.

‚úÖ Step-by-Step Fix
1. Ensure the user is mapped in the EKS cluster
Make sure your IAM user is mapped in the aws-auth ConfigMap under mapUsers or access_entries (if using authentication_mode = "API"):

yaml
mapUsers: |
  - userarn: arn:aws:iam::255945442255:user/clifford_ce9
    username: clifford_ce9
    groups:
      - argocd-readers

Or if using API mode with access_entries in Terraform:

hcl
access_entries {
  kubernetes_groups = ["argocd-readers"]
  principal_arn     = "arn:aws:iam::255945442255:user/clifford_ce9"
  type              = "STANDARD"
}

2. Create an RBAC Role and RoleBinding
Create a Role and RoleBinding in the argocd namespace:

yaml
# rbac-argocd-readers.yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: argocd
  name: argocd-read-role
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["services"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]

---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: argocd-read-binding
  namespace: argocd
subjects:
- kind: Group
  name: argocd-readers     # Group from aws-auth mapping
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: argocd-read-role
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io

Apply with:

bash
kubectl apply -f rbac-argocd-readers.yaml
