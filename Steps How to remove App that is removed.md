Are you sure you want to delete 'apps' and all its resources? [y/n] y

This is a tricky but known issue: Argo CD won‚Äôt let you even delete an application if it references a non-existent project.

‚ùå rpc error: ... app is not allowed in project "ingress-aalimsee"

‚úÖ Solution: Patch the Application's Project to "default" (via kubectl)
Since Argo CD stores applications as Kubernetes CRs (Custom Resources), you can patch it manually.

üõ† Step 1: Patch the apps Application
bash
kubectl patch application apps -n argocd --type merge -p '{"spec":{"project":"default"}}'

üßπ Step 2: Delete it after patching
Once patched, now delete it cleanly:

bash
argocd app delete apps --cascade

Let me know once you‚Äôve run that ‚Äî or if you'd prefer I give you the full kubectl delete method too (bypasses Argo CD CLI).
